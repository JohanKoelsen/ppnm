Part A: First we test the linear interpolation function at value z.\ With the x and y list:
x: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
y: 1 4.3 9.6 16.9 26.2 37.5 50.8 
Now we test our linear interpolator and integrator vs GSL.
The interpolated value at z = 3.5 is 21.55.
We now calculate the integral of the linear spline of the tabulated data from the point x[0] = 0 to the point z = 3.5.
The value is 32.4625.

The GSL interpolation  at z = 3.5 yield 21.3048.
The integrated value from GSL from x[0] = 0 to z = 3.5 yield 31.9282.
The comparison between the interpolations and integrations are shown in the linplot.png and integplot.png.

Binsearch at z = 5.21 yields 3.
