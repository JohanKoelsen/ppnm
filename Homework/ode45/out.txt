Part A: ode45 has solved the harmonic differential equation. The plot is shown in harmonics.png
Part A 2): Investigating the effect of increasing T_c is done by solving the fSIR multiple times with increasing T_c.

We can see that increasing T_C decreases the maximum amount of infected as well as shifting the solution to the left.
The solutions are plotted in sir1.png, sir2.png and sir3.png.

Part B: {ti, y(ti)} is stored in the given path in the driver function

Part C: stable 3-body orbit.
