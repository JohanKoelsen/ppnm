ANN part A, plotting the parameters for the activation function, the derivative and the antiderivative (ai, bi, wi) for the 3 neurons.
The activation function is x*exp(-x^2)

i=0, ai, bi, wi = -0.295278 0.966774 1.32748
i=1, ai, bi, wi = 0.839928 1.12631 0.853293
i=2, ai, bi, wi = 2.3961 1.00446 0.525003


For part B, the values for the function sin(x)*exp(-x) (with its derivative and antiderivative) and the approximated points are shown in plot.png
