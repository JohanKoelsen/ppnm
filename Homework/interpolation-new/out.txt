Part A: First we test the linear interpolation function at value z.\ With the x and y list:
x: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
y: 1 3.3 5.6 7.9 10.2 12.5 14.8 
The interpolated value at z = 3.5 is 9.05.
We now calculate the integral of the linear spline of the tabulated data from the point x[0] = 0 to the point z = 3.5.
The value is 17.5875.
