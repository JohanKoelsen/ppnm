Part A: recursive adaptive integration. In this part the code integrate two expressions, f = sqrt(x) and f = 4*(1-x^2) over some intervals.

f = sqrt(x) from 0 to 1
Q = 0.666722
exact = 0.666667
calls = 24
estimated error = 0.000166672
actual error = 5.55411e-05

f = 4*sqrt(1-x^2) from 0 to 1
Q = 3.14163
exact = 3.14159
calls = 48
estimated error = 0.000414163
actual error = 3.46698e-05

Part B: an  adaptive integrator with the Clenshawâ€“Curtis variable transformation is implemented, tested and specifically calculating the
integral of f(x) = 4*srqt(1-x^2) from 0 to 1

f from 0 to 1 : CLENSHAW_CURTIS
Q = 3.14159
exact = 3.14159
calls = 56
estimated error = 0.000414159
actual error = 2.23694e-06
By comparing with the previous integration from part A, we can see that the result is more correct, however the number of calls and the error is larger.

The GSL's integration routines provide = 3.141593 with 231 number of calls. The error is 0.00015548.
While providing the correct result, the number of calls is larger.
